# NoSQL Homework: Social Network API

## Description

The objective of this project was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. This homework met the following acceptance criteria:

GIVEN a social network API, WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application, THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts, THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia, THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list

## Installation

Make sure to have express and mongoose npm packages installed via the command line. First you will need to seed the data by running "npm run seed." Then you can start the server with "node server.js" and open insomnia to test the routes.
